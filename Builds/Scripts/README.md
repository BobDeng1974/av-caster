the build helper scripts contained in this directory are intentionally non-executable and are intended to be run from the project root directory (the directory containing the Builds and Source directories)

firstly, run the setup-build-helpers script in this directory to copy these scripts to the project root - they will be copied to the project root and set to be executable from there

from this directory
```
./setup-build-helpers
cd ../../
```
from the project root directory
```
Builds/Scripts/setup-build-helpers
```
